
#Set up like the first class trial of danganronpa 1
#each phase presents the player with 3-5 clues, and once they are
#all collected, the player can begin figuring out which statement
#they think is false.
#when collecting clues, the minigame should be set up but pretty easy
#and then once clues are collected, it should turn it up to 11
#have a survival minigame, with clues that
#need to be collected, and then used to disprove certain statements.
#the player cannot pick whodunnit until the last phase.
#weapons could be used as enemies, if the player runs out of attempts in the
#current phase, they are guilty and die.
#statements can be destroyed by truth bullets to go to the next phase.(if correct)
#And if they hit a weapon, they lose one heart out of 5.
#hearts reset after each phase ends.
#between each phase, i will have a manditory reload confirm to ensure the player
#is ready.(could also give me time to give context about important details.)
