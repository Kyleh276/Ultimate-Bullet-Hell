## Ultimate Bullet Hell (Demo)

This project is a simple game that I made and it is inspired by the Danganronpa franchise.
I used python because I love using python for smaller lightweight applications and automation.
I used pygame because I am familiar with it and it fits the needs that I had for the project.
This project was a long time running, as the original version was created a few years before this one.
This project was challenging when I first wrote it because of how interactive and fast I wanted it to be.
Once I returned to the project idea, I had gained much more of a concrete understanding of how to write it.
I really enjoyed rewriting and optimizing it this time around.

#### Features i'd like to add:

 - Adding a way for the player to regain lives.
 - Adding new stages that have different twists.
 - Adding a way to beat each stage by collecting clues.
 - Adding a final stage that is inspired by the class trials in Danganronpa.
 - Add a way to save progress and or high scores.
 - Add a dedicated .exe version for easy installation.

#### Requirements:

- Windows 10
- Python is noted in the system's `PATH` variable.
- Python 3.9.1 or newer is installed.
- Pip is noted in the system's `PATH` variable.
- Pygame library for Python 3 is installed.

#### Project Installation

##### Windows 10:

This program requires Windows to work, it could likely work on other Operating Systems such as Linux, but it has not yet been tested on anything except Win10. 
As such any errors relating to differing operating systems are not my concern until I test those specific operating systems.

##### Python Install:
    
Install `Python 3.9.1` or newer.
[Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

##### Python on PATH:

- Once Python is installed, make sure it is on the `PATH` variable by opening `Command Prompt`.
- Once it opens, type `Python` and hit `Enter` on the keyboard.
- If you see `Python 3.9.1`, then python is on your path.
- If you see `python is not recognized` then add the folder that contains `Python.exe` to the system `PATH` variable.
- Make sure `pip` is on the system `PATH`.
- Do the same thing you did to check if Python is on the system `PATH` variable except type `pip` instead of `python`
if the command is not recognized, add the folder that contains `pip.exe` to the `PATH` system variable.

##### Pygame install:

Open `Command Prompt` in `Administator` mode.
Type `pip install pygame`.

##### Startup:

- Download the project files, navigate to the `Code` folder and then double click the `Ultimate Bullet Hell (Demo).pyw` file.
- If the project does not open, make sure that `Python 3.9.1` and `Pygame` are installed.


#### How to use:

- Once the demo is open, to play click the `Play` button.
- You will start with `5` lives.
- Dodge the falling monokumas for as long as you can.
- If you run out of lives, but still want to keep playing click the `Retry` button.
- If you want to quit after running out of lives, click the `Quit` button.
